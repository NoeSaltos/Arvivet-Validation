### Problem Statement

At "ARVIVET", a veterinary center with two branches in Guayaquil, the manual processes of managing appointments and tracking medical records are leading to inefficiencies and operational challenges. This situation creates several issues, such as overlapping appointments, missed follow-ups, and delays in communication between the staff and customers. These inefficiencies can negatively impact customer satisfaction and the overall quality of veterinary care, as well as hinder the centerâ€™s ability to grow and improve its services. Our counterpart will be Dr. Diana Armijos, owner of the center and main veterinarian.

### Importance of the App

The proposed application is crucial because it will transform how veterinary services are managed at "ARVIVET". By digitizing appointment management, automating notifications, and centralizing medical records, the app will enable smoother, more efficient interaction between the clinic and its clients. This is especially important in a fast-paced environment where time management and effective communication are key to delivering high-quality care. The app ensures that clients have an easy and accessible way to interact with the veterinary staff, helping reduce errors, minimize delays, and improve overall customer experience.
